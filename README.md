# PlasmaDispRel

All dispersion relations are defined in the file DispRel.py

The file ComputeDispRel.py contains a method to evaluate the dispersion relations in DispRel.py

Finally, an example of how to call ComputeDispRel.py is found in Examples.ipynb, where various dispersion relations for lower hybrid wavs and ion Bernstein waves are evaluated.
