# PlasmaDispRel

This is a python code to calculate dispersion curves for lower hybrid waves and ion Bernstein waves propagating perpendicularly to the background magnetic field.

All equations are derived in the paper "On the dispersion relations for perpendicularly propagating ion Bernstein waves and lower hybrid waves" (add correct citation).

The file DispRel.py contains the definitions of all the dispersion relations.

The file ComputeDispRel.py contains a method to evaluate the dispersion relations in DispRel.py

Finally, an example of how to call ComputeDispRel.py is found in Examples.ipynb, where various dispersion relations for lower hybrid wavs and ion Bernstein waves are evaluated.
